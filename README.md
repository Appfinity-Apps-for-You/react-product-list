# React + TypeScript + MUI + Vite learning project

**react-product-list** is a frontend development learning project developed at [Appfinity](https://appfinity.pl). Drawing inspiration from the [React.dev](https://react.dev) tutorial we created this project to show how to combine the power of [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) as well as [MUI](https://mui.com) components. The SPA application development environment is set up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a robust frontend tool.
